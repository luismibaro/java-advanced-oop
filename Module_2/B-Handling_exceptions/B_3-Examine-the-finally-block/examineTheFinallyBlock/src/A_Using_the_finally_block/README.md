# Explanation
- The code does not cause an Exceptino because it attempts to print the element at index 4 in the array.
As a result 50 is printed and the catch block handling the ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException is not invoked.
Instead, the finally block is executed printing the message: "In the finally block!" After that "More code"
is printed, indicating that any code following the try-catch-finally block is executed smoothly.
