## Explanation:
This code throws an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException. However, the catch block is designed to handle
the ArithmeticException. Since no code is present to handle the ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException,
the finally block is executed printing the message: "In the finally block", then the exception
details is printed, and because the Exception is not handled, the program is abnormally terminated, 
and the line of code placed after the try-catch-finallyBlock never gets executed.
